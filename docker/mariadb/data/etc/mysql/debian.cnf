# THIS FILE IS OBSOLETE. STOP USING IT IF POSSIBLE.
# This file exists only for backwards compatibility for
# tools that run '--defaults-file=/etc/mysql/debian.cnf'
# and have root level access to the local filesystem.
# With those permissions one can run 'mariadb' directly
# anyway thanks to unix socket authentication and hence
# this file is useless. See package README for more info.
